# Final Year Project (FYP) – Human Pose Estimation & Performance Analysis

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for my Final Year Project. The project focuses on human pose estimation using the YOLOv8 model and analyzes performance metrics based on movement tracking.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main_mp.py`: Main script to run pose estimation using MediaPipe or YOLO.
- `dashboard.py`: Visual dashboard to display and interpret results.
- `utils_mp.py`: Utility functions for MediaPipe-based processing.
- `data.py`, `guide.py`, `person.py`: Supporting Python modules.
- `Documents/`: Contains the final report and technical paper.
- `yolov8n.engine`, `yolov8n-pose.engine`: Optimized engine files for YOLO inference.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time human pose detection
- Metric tracking for physical activities
- Exportable performance data for further analysis
- Visual dashboard for reporting

## 📄 Documents

Final project documentation can be found in the `Documents/` folder:
- Final Year Project Report (PDF)
- Technical Paper (PDF)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- YOLOv8
- plotly (for visualizations)

## 🔒 Sensitive Files

Some files (e.g., large model weights, keys) are excluded or removed due to size/security concerns. Refer to `.gitignore` and GitHub push protection rules.
