# Final Year Project (FYP) – Human Pose Estimation & Performance Analysis
This project is developed as part of a Final Year Project to track and analyze soccer juggling performance using YOLOv8 Pose Estimation and Python multiprocessing to improve processing efficiency.
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for my Final Year Project. The project focuses on human pose estimation using the YOLOv8 model and analyzes performance metrics based on movement tracking.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main_mp.py`: Main script utilizing multiprocessing for video frame analysis.
- `dashboard.py`: Visual dashboard to display and interpret results.
- `utils_mp.py`: Utility functions designed to work efficiently with multiple processes.
- `data.py`, `guide.py`, `person.py`: Supporting Python modules.
- `Documents/`: Contains the final report and technical paper.
- `yolov8n.engine`, `yolov8n-pose.engine`: Optimized engine files for YOLO inference.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time human pose detection
- Metric tracking for physical activities
- Exportable performance data for further analysis
- Visual dashboard for reporting

## 📄 Documents

Final project documentation can be found in the `Documents/` folder:
- Final Year Project Report (PDF)
- Technical Paper (PDF)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 3.10

Ultralytics YOLOv8

Multiprocessing for parallel data processing

OpenCV for image and video handling

## 🔒 Sensitive Files

Some files (e.g., large model weights, keys) are excluded or removed due to size/security concerns. Refer to `.gitignore` and GitHub push protection rules.
